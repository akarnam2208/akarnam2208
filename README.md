#### Hi everybody ðŸ‘‹
My name is Aditya Karnam and I am senior pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering. 
I like to browse about different types of Aircraft (both Commercial & Defense) in my free-time. 

In this class I am interested to master about how to program using the C programming language along with writing reports using latex. 

My favorite hobbies are playing Cricket, Soccer, watching Formula 1 and running outdoors. 

I am currently working on the first homework.
